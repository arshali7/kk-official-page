        Mechanical Engineering is the art and science of designing, development and control of systems and components such as fluid mechanics, material science, thermodynamics, kinematics, etc. Mechanical engineers use these core concepts along with tools like computer-aided design (CAD), and product lifecycle management to design, analyze and manufacturing of equipments. The Mechanical Engineering department has got a pool of qualified and experienced professors. It is known to all that from steam engine to aircrafts to rockets and everything we come across is embedded with a significant contribution from mechanical engineering aspects. Mechanical engineers are pushing the wheel of civilization ahead.<br><br>

Mechanical Engineering at K. K. College of Engineering & Management, Jharkhand's Best Engineering College works in the pursuit of how things work and bringing it into the real world execution. This learning enriched department delivers the best program with the aim to nurture the students and transform them into engineers capable of high-level of performance.

        Electrical engineering generally deals with the study and application of electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism, which is further subdivided into a wide range of subfields including electronics, digital computers, power engineering, telecommunications, control systems, instrumentation, and microelectronics. Critical skills needed in electrical engineering include an in-depth understanding of electrical and electronic theory, mathematics and materials. This knowledge allows engineers to design circuits to perform specific functions and meet requirements for safety, reliability and energy efficiency, and to predict how they will behave, before a hardware design is implemented.<br><br>

This department has got a pool of talented, highly qualified and experienced professors with industrial experience. The department has a strong industry interaction together with commitment to strengthen the students in theoretical and practical aspects. The faculty members of the department are also engaged in active research in coveted institutions.
