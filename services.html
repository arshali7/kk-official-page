<center><i>If you don't understand something or find yourself confused, ask questions. Use the course instructors and teaching assistants as your resources for helping you learn.</i></center>

<center><h><b><u>The Categories of Book Hunters</u></b></h></center>
We should provide access to books in our classes with the same differentiated approach that we bring to any other lesson, assessment, or activity because there are, I believe, four categories of students who pursue books.<br><br>
students who will seek out the book they want, regardless of locale. They get a mere whiff of a good book in the air, and they pursue it. They understand how to choose books and seek out advice.<br><br>
Students who are so frightened of books, of literacy, and of choice, that they feel comfortable only in their classroom library, reaching for books they know exactly where to find and trusting you, who understands their fears and reading insecurities.<br><br>
Libraries are welcoming havens for ideas that everyone can enjoy, value, and use on aregular   basis.   Long   passageways   to   rows   of   books   are   almost   always   present   inlibraries. It contains materials that are organised in a specific order according to alibrary classification scheme, making it easier to find items and browse collections.Aside from the public galleries, some libraries have private galleries where referencematerials   are   kept.   Selected  members   may   have  access   to  these   reference   stacks.Others require patrons to make a "stack request," which is a request that an assistantretrieve material from the closed stacks. In today's world, most libraries offer freeaccess to their entire collection.<br><br>
